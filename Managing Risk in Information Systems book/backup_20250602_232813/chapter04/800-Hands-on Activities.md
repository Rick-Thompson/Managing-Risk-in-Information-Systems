### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Backup Strategy Analysis
Review the backup strategy of a real organization (your school, workplace, or a case study). Identify how it aligns with or diverges from the 3-2-1 rule. Document potential vulnerabilities and suggest improvements based on principles discussed in this chapter.

#### Exercise 2: Media Selection Scenario
Your organization needs to implement a backup solution for 5TB of critical business data. Research and compare at least three different media options (e.g., external HDDs, NAS, cloud storage, tape). Create a recommendation based on factors including cost, security, ease of use, and recovery capabilities.

#### Exercise 3: Backup Security Assessment
Configure a simple backup system on your personal computer using built-in tools or free backup software. Perform a security analysis of your implementation, identifying potential vulnerabilities and determining what additional security measures would be appropriate.

### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Cloud Recovery Strategy Assessment
You are a consultant advising a mid-sized financial services company considering migration of critical applications to cloud infrastructure. Based on the AWS outage case study and other cloud resilience lessons discussed in this chapter:

1. Develop evaluation criteria for assessing different cloud recovery architecture options
2. Create a comparison matrix analyzing single-region with redundancy, multi-region active-passive, and multi-region active-active approaches
3. Identify potential singleton dependencies that might undermine resilience despite geographic distribution
4. Recommend monitoring and testing approaches specifically addressing cloud recovery validation

Present your assessment as a consultant report with specific recommendations tailored to financial services regulatory requirements.

#### Exercise 2: Ransomware Recovery Plan Development
Design a ransomware-specific disaster recovery plan for a healthcare organization operating a mid-sized hospital. Your plan should address:

1. Early detection mechanisms for potential ransomware activity
2. Immediate response procedures upon ransomware detection
3. System isolation strategies preventing malware propagation
4. Data restoration approaches from protected backup sources
5. Operational continuity measures during system unavailability

Include both technical and organizational components in your plan, with particular attention to patient care continuity during extended system unavailability.

#### Exercise 3: Post-Disaster Analysis Framework
Develop a comprehensive post-disaster analysis framework for evaluating recovery effectiveness following a significant system disruption. Your framework should include:

1. Timeline reconstruction methodology capturing both technical events and organizational responses
2. Root cause analysis approach addressing technical, process, and organizational dimensions
3. Impact assessment structure quantifying disruption consequences across multiple dimensions
4. Response effectiveness evaluation criteria for both technical and procedural components
5. Improvement identification and tracking methodology ensuring actual capability enhancement

Present your framework as a practical guide that could be implemented following an actual disaster, including sample templates for different analysis components.

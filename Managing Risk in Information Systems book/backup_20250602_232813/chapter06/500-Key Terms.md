### Key Terms

- **Bare-Metal Recovery**: Restoration to completely new or wiped hardware, typically including operating system, applications, and data.
- **Checksum**: A cryptographic hash value used to verify data integrity throughout the backup and restoration process.
- **Continuous Data Protection (CDP)**: A backup approach that captures and replicates changes continuously rather than at scheduled intervals.
- **Immutable Backup**: Backup data that cannot be modified or deleted once created, protecting against ransomware attacks targeting backup systems.
- **Instant Recovery**: Technology that provides immediate access to backup data without waiting for full restoration completion.
- **Parallel Restoration**: Recovery approach that simultaneously restores multiple systems rather than proceeding sequentially.
- **Point-in-Time Restoration**: Recovery to a specific moment in time rather than simply the most recent backup.
- **Recovery Orchestration**: Automated systems that coordinate complex restoration processes across multiple interdependent systems.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time between service disruption and restoration.
- **Tabletop Exercise**: A discussion-based simulation that verbally walks through disaster recovery scenarios without actual system manipulation.

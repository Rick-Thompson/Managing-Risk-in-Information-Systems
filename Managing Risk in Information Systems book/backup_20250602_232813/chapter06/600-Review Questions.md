### Review Questions

1. How does a full system restoration differ from file-level recovery, and what factors would influence the choice between these approaches during an actual recovery situation?

2. When implementing a backup testing strategy, why is it insufficient to verify only that files can be restored without also confirming application functionality?

3. Explain how checksums contribute to backup validation, and identify at least two scenarios where checksums alone might prove insufficient for complete validation.

4. What advantages do simulated disaster scenarios provide beyond basic restore testing, and how might these exercises be structured to maximize their value without disrupting normal operations?

5. Based on the GitLab data loss incident, what specific validation failures contributed to their inability to recover, and how could these have been prevented through proper testing?

6. Describe three specific techniques for recovery time optimization and explain how each contributes to reduced downtime during restoration events.

7. What unique validation challenges exist for database restoration that might not apply to standard file system recovery?

8. How does point-in-time restoration differ from standard recovery, and what additional validation requirements does this approach introduce?

9. Explain how immutable backup architectures protect against ransomware threats, and what validation approaches would confirm their effectiveness.

10. How does instant recovery technology change traditional restoration approaches, and what validation considerations become particularly important when implementing this technology?

### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: File-level Restore Testing
Implement a file-level restoration test for different file types including documents, images, and database files. For each file type:
1. Create sample files with known content
2. Back up these files using available backup tools
3. Delete or modify the original files
4. Restore from backup
5. Verify not only file presence but content integrity and functionality

Document your findings including any unexpected challenges encountered during the restoration process.

#### Exercise 2: Point-in-Time Recovery Validation
Design and implement a point-in-time validation procedure for a simple database system:
1. Create a test database with a simple table structure
2. Add records at specific time intervals, documenting exactly what was added when
3. Configure appropriate backup processes to enable point-in-time recovery
4. Attempt restoration to three different time points
5. Validate that each restoration contains exactly the expected records without contamination from later time periods

Analyze any discrepancies between expected and actual restoration results.

#### Exercise 3: Disaster Recovery Simulation
Plan and conduct a simple disaster recovery tabletop exercise:
1. Define a specific disaster scenario (e.g., ransomware infection, server hardware failure)
2. Identify systems affected and restoration priorities
3. Document the theoretical recovery process including who would perform which actions
4. For critical systems, outline specific technical steps required for restoration
5. Identify potential obstacles or dependencies that might delay recovery
6. Document resources required for successful recovery

Present your findings as a recovery playbook that could guide actual response during a similar real-world incident.

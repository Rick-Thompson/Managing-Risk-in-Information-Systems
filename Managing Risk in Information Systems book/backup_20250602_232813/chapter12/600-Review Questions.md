1. How did NotPetya differ from traditional ransomware, and what evidence suggested it was designed primarily as a destructive weapon rather than for financial gain?

2. What was the initial attack vector for the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, and how might this have been prevented?

3. Why did Colonial Pipeline shut down its pipeline operations even though the ransomware only directly affected its IT systems, not its operational technology systems?

4. Explain what made the Log4j vulnerability (Log4Shell) particularly dangerous in terms of its ease of exploitation and widespread impact.

5. What is "dependency blindness," and how did it complicate organizations' responses to the Log4j vulnerability?

6. How did the NotPetya attack demonstrate the potential for global collateral damage from geopolitically motivated cyberattacks?

7. Describe the relationship between IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) networks in critical infrastructure, and how this relationship affected the Colonial Pipeline incident.

8. What were the major regulatory and policy responses to the Colonial Pipeline attack, and how did they signal a shift in the government's approach to critical infrastructure cybersecurity?

9. Identify three disciplines or perspectives that contribute to cross-disciplinary incident analysis, and explain how each provides unique insights into complex security incidents.

10. What are the key steps in the scenario planning process, and how does this methodology help organizations prepare for future security threats?

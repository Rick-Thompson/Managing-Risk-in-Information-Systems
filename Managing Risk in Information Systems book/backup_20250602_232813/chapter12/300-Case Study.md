#### Case Study: The Fictional MediTech Ransomware Incident

MediTech Regional Hospital, a 350-bed facility serving a metropolitan area of approximately 500,000 people, experienced a ransomware attack at 2:00 AM on a Tuesday morning. The hospital's IT team was alerted when multiple clinical systems began displaying ransom notes demanding $4.5 million in cryptocurrency.

Initial investigation revealed that the attackers had gained access to the network three weeks earlier through a phishing email that targeted the human resources department. The email contained a malicious attachment disguised as a job application. Once opened, the malware established a backdoor that allowed the attackers to move laterally through the network, eventually compromising domain administrator credentials.

The ransomware affected multiple critical systems, including:
- Electronic health records (EHR)
- Pharmacy management
- Laboratory information systems
- Radiology information systems
- Email and internal communication tools

Fortunately, the hospital had implemented network segmentation that prevented the malware from affecting certain critical systems:
- Life support equipment remained operational
- Emergency room systems maintained limited functionality
- Backup systems remained uncompromised

The hospital activated its incident response plan, establishing a command center and switching to paper-based processes where necessary. However, several challenges quickly emerged:
- Staff were unfamiliar with paper-based workflows, causing delays in patient care
- Critical patient history was inaccessible, requiring repeated diagnostic tests
- Coordination between departments became extremely difficult without electronic communications
- Media began reporting on the incident, creating public relations challenges

After 48 hours, the hospital's leadership faced a critical decision: pay the ransom or continue recovery from backups. The estimated time to restore all systems from backups was 7-10 days, during which patient care would be significantly impaired. The FBI advised against paying, while clinical leadership emphasized the potential patient safety impacts of prolonged system downtime.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What factors should the hospital leadership consider when deciding whether to pay the ransom?
2. What could the organization have done differently to prevent the initial compromise or limit its spread?
3. How should the hospital communicate about this incident to patients, staff, and the public?
4. What cross-disciplinary skills and perspectives would be valuable on the incident response team?
5. What lessons from the Colonial Pipeline and NotPetya incidents could be applied to this scenario?
6. How could scenario planning have helped the hospital prepare more effectively for this type of incident?

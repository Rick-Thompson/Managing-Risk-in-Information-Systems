### Key Terms

- **Chain of Custody**: Documentation establishing who handled evidence, when, and how, maintaining verifiable accountability throughout the evidence lifecycle.
- **Containment**: Actions taken to limit incident spread and prevent additional damage during security incidents.
- **Eradication**: Activities focused on removing attacker presence from affected systems and addressing vulnerabilities that enabled the initial compromise.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Security technology focusing on workstation and server monitoring, providing visibility into potentially malicious activities occurring on these devices.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Detailed examination of affected systems to determine attack methodologies, compromise timelines, and potential data exposure.
- **Incident Classification**: The process of categorizing security events based on characteristics including system criticality, data sensitivity, attack sophistication, and potential business impact.
- **Incident Response Lifecycle**: The structured framework for managing security incidents from initial preparation through detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident learning.
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Structured examination of both attack and response effectiveness conducted after incident resolution to drive security enhancements.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The process of identifying underlying conditions enabling a security incident rather than merely addressing immediate technical symptoms.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Technology providing centralized collection, correlation, and analysis capabilities for security-relevant data across the organization.

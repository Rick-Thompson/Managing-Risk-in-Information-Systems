### Hands-on Activities

1. **Risk Identification Exercise**: Identify the information systems you interact with daily (e.g., university registration system, banking app). For each system, brainstorm potential threats and their impacts.
2. **Stakeholder Analysis**: Select an organization you're familiar with and identify the key stakeholders who would be involved in information systems risk management. Describe their roles and concerns.
3. **Business Case Development**: Develop a simple business case for a security improvement (e.g., multi-factor authentication) that connects the investment to business outcomes.
4. **Incident Response Tabletop**: With a small group, walk through how you would respond to a simulated incident (e.g., ransomware attack on a university system).

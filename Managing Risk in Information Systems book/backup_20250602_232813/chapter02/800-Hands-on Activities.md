### Hands on Activities

#### Exercise 1: Asset Inventory and Valuation
Consider a small medical clinic with the following elements: electronic health record system, patient scheduling system, billing software, staff workstations, network infrastructure, and physical patient files. Create an asset inventory that includes each item's owner, location, and purpose. Then assign classification levels based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements, and estimate the value of each asset considering both tangible and intangible factors.

#### Exercise 2: STRIDE Threat Modeling
Select one of the following systems and apply the STRIDE methodology to identify potential threats:
- A mobile banking application
- A university student information system
- An industrial control system for a power plant
For each component of your chosen system, identify at least one potential threat in each STRIDE category. Document your findings in a threat register, including a brief description of how each threat might manifest and what assets would be affected.

#### Exercise 3: DREAD Risk Assessment
Using the threats identified in Exercise 2, select the three that you believe represent the highest risk. Apply the DREAD methodology to prioritize these threats, assigning a score from 1-10 for each of the five DREAD criteria. Calculate the average score for each threat and rank them by severity. Write a brief justification for your scoring decisions, explaining why you assigned each value.

#### Exercise 4: Vulnerability Assessment Planning
You are responsible for security at a medium-sized e-commerce company. Design a comprehensive vulnerability assessment strategy that includes automated scanning, manual testing, configuration reviews, and social engineering assessments. Specify which tools and techniques you would use for each component, which systems would receive priority attention, and how often each type of assessment would be conducted. Develop a schedule for implementing your strategy over a 12-month period.

#### Exercise 5: Risk Treatment Options
For each of the following scenarios, recommend an appropriate risk treatment strategy (accept, avoid, transfer, or reduce) and justify your recommendation:
- A legacy system with known vulnerabilities that supports a critical business function with no modern replacement available
- A proposed new customer service chatbot that would collect and process personal information
- A physical server room with inadequate environmental controls but limited history of environmental incidents
- A third-party software-as-a-service application used for non-sensitive internal communication
For the "reduce" options, specify what controls you would implement to mitigate the risk.

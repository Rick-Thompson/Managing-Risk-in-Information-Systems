**Discussion Questions:**

1. How might a formal asset identification, classification, and valuation process have helped TechRetail prevent this breach or reduce its impact?

2. Apply the STRIDE methodology to identify what types of threats materialized in this incident. What additional threats might exist that haven't yet been exploited?

3. If TechRetail had used the DREAD methodology to assess the vulnerability that was exploited, how would you have scored it on each of the five criteria? Would it likely have been prioritized for immediate remediation?

4. Design a basic risk management program for TechRetail moving forward, including recommended processes, roles and responsibilities, and technology investments.

5. What risk treatment options should TechRetail consider for the various risks identified in the aftermath of this breach?

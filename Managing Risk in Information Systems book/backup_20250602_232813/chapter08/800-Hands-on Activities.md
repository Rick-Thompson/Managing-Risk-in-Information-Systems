2. Internal document management system used for policy and procedure access with a 24-hour RPO and 48-hour RTO
3. Regulatory reporting system generating monthly compliance reports with a 72-hour RPO and 96-hour RTO

For each system, justify your strategy selection based on business requirements, technical characteristics, and resource constraints. Consider both technical and organizational factors in your justification.

#### Exercise 2: Crisis Communication Plan Development

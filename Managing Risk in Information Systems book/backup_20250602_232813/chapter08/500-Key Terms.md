### Key Terms

- **Active-Active Configuration**: A recovery approach where both primary and secondary systems simultaneously process workloads, providing both redundancy and additional operational capacity.
- **Active-Passive Configuration**: A recovery approach where secondary systems remain idle during normal operations but activate when primary systems fail.
- **Business Continuity Planning (BCP)**: The comprehensive process of identifying potential threats and their business impacts, then developing frameworks for organizational resilience protecting key business functions.
- **Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)**: The process focused specifically on restoring technology infrastructure and information systems after catastrophic events.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: The maximum acceptable data loss measured in time, determining backup frequency and replication requirements.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time between system disruption and restoration, determining appropriate recovery strategy selection.
- **Replication**: Technology that continuously copies data changes from production systems to recovery environments, maintaining near-real-time duplicates ready for activation.
- **Tabletop Exercise**: A discussion-based simulation where participants verbally work through disaster scenarios without actual system manipulation.
- **Technical Recovery Team**: Personnel with specialized expertise responsible for restoring specific infrastructure components or application systems during disasters.
- **Virtualization**: Technology separating logical system configurations from physical hardware dependencies, enhancing recovery flexibility by enabling restoration to different physical infrastructure.

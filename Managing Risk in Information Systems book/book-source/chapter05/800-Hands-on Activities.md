### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Backup Schedule Design
Design a weekly backup schedule for a small business with the following characteristics:
- Core business hours: Monday-Friday, 8 AM to 6 PM
- Critical financial database (500 GB)
- Email system (2 TB)
- File shares (5 TB)
- Available backup window: 8 PM to 6 AM on weekdays, all day on weekends
- Available network bandwidth: 1 Gbps internal, 100 Mbps to offsite storage

Document your schedule with justification for timing decisions and estimates of completion times for each component.

#### Exercise 2: Retention Policy Development
Develop a tiered retention policy for a healthcare provider that must balance operational needs, legal requirements, and storage costs. Your policy should address:
- Patient records (subject to HIPAA requirements)
- Financial transactions
- Email communications
- System configuration backups

For each data type, specify retention periods, storage locations, and transition rules between storage tiers.

#### Exercise 3: Backup Validation Protocol
Create a comprehensive validation protocol for a critical database system. Your protocol should include:
- Immediate post-backup validation techniques
- Scheduled test restoration procedures
- Documentation requirements for validation results
- Escalation procedures for validation failures
- Success criteria for different validation levels

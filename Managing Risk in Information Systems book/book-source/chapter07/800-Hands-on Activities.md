### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Critical Function Analysis
Select a familiar organization (your university, employer, or a well-known company) and identify five potential critical functions across different departments. For each function:
1. Document basic process description and business purpose
2. Identify key technology dependencies required for operation
3. Assess potential impacts across financial, operational, and reputational dimensions
4. Propose appropriate RTO and RPO values based on your impact assessment
5. Recommend a continuity strategy aligned with the established recovery objectives

Present your analysis as a critical function register that could serve as the foundation for a more comprehensive BIA.

#### Exercise 2: Stakeholder Communication Plan
Develop a communication plan for a hypothetical service disruption affecting an e-commerce platform. Your plan should address:
1. Identification of at least five stakeholder groups with different information needs
2. Message templates for initial notification, status updates, and recovery completion
3. Channel strategy identifying appropriate communication methods for each stakeholder group
4. Timing strategy establishing communication frequency throughout the disruption lifecycle
5. Responsibility assignments identifying who creates, approves, and delivers different communications

Present your plan as a practical reference document that could guide communication during an actual disruption.

#### Exercise 3: Recovery Procedure Development
Create a detailed recovery procedure for restoring a critical business application after a system failure. Your procedure should include:
1. Activation criteria determining when the procedure should be implemented
2. Sequential recovery steps with clear responsibility assignments
3. Decision points with defined criteria for different response paths
4. Verification methods confirming successful completion of key steps
5. Escalation procedures for obtaining assistance when challenges arise

Format your procedure as an actionable checklist that could be followed during an actual disruption event.

### Hands on Activities

1. **Incident Timeline Construction**: Select either the NotPetya, Colonial Pipeline, or Log4j incident. Research additional details about the event and construct a detailed timeline that includes attacker actions, defender responses, and key external developments. Identify at least three critical decision points where different choices could have significantly altered the outcome.

2. **Cross-Disciplinary Analysis**: Choose a recent cybersecurity incident not covered in this chapter. Analyze it from at least three different perspectives (technical, operational, economic, geopolitical, or psychological). Write a brief analysis explaining how each perspective contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the incident.

3. **Scenario Development Workshop**: Working in small groups, develop a plausible future attack scenario that builds upon techniques seen in one of the incidents covered in this chapter but incorporates a novel twist or technology. Create a detailed narrative of how this attack might unfold, including initial access, lateral movement, and business impact. Present your scenario to the class and discuss potential mitigation strategies.

4. **Tabletop Exercise Participation**: Participate in a classroom tabletop exercise simulating an incident response scenario. Assume an assigned role (technical responder, communications lead, executive, etc.) and work collaboratively to address the unfolding situation. Document key decisions made during the exercise and reflect on what you learned about incident response dynamics.

5. **Dependency Mapping Project**: For a simple web or mobile application of your choice, create a dependency map that identifies both direct and transitive dependencies. Research whether any of these dependencies have had significant security vulnerabilities in the past. Develop recommendations for how organizations can better manage the security implications of these dependencies.

6. **Security Control Mapping**: For the Log4j vulnerability, identify and document at least five different security controls that could have mitigated the risk at different stages (prevention, detection, containment, and eradication). Explain how each control would function and its relative effectiveness.

7. **Media Analysis**: Collect news articles about one of the major incidents covered in this chapter from at least three different sources. Analyze how the technical details were presented to non-technical audiences and identify any misconceptions or oversimplifications in the reporting. Propose how security professionals could better communicate about complex incidents to the general public.

8. **Recovery Time Estimation**: For a hypothetical organization of your choice (e.g., a hospital, university, or retail business), estimate how long it would take to recover from a NotPetya-style attack. Consider factors such as backup strategies, network segmentation, and operational dependencies. Document your assumptions and develop a staged recovery plan.

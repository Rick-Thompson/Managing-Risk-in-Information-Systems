- **Master Boot Record (MBR)**: A critical part of a computer's hard drive that contains information about the disk layout and how the operating system boots.

- **Critical Infrastructure**: Systems and assets so vital that their incapacity would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety.

- **Zero-Day Vulnerability**: A software security flaw that is unknown to those who should be interested in mitigating it, including the vendor, and for which no patch exists.

- **Operational Technology (OT)**: Hardware and software that detects or causes changes in physical processes through direct monitoring and/or control of physical devices.

### Hands on Activites

1. **Breach Timeline Analysis**: Select a major breach not covered in this chapter and create a detailed timeline of events. Identify at least three points where different security controls might have prevented the breach from progressing.

2. **Control Mapping Exercise**: Take the NIST Cybersecurity Framework core and map which controls would have prevented or detected each stage of the Equifax breach.

3. **Tabletop Exercise**: Develop a tabletop exercise for your class that simulates a supply chain attack similar to SolarWinds. Create roles for different team members and specific injects that test response capabilities.

4. **Risk Assessment Application**: Using your organization (or school) as a model, assess whether it would be vulnerable to the same issues that enabled the Target breach. Document specific controls that either exist or should be implemented.

5. **Security Metrics Development**: Design three security metrics that would help detect the type of activity seen in these major breaches. For each metric, specify what data would be collected, how it would be analyzed, and what thresholds would trigger alerts.

### Key Terms

- **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)**: The expected monetary loss from a particular risk over a one-year period, calculated by multiplying the Annual Rate of Occurrence by the Single Loss Expectancy.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: A systematic approach to comparing the costs of implementing security controls against the benefits of reduced risk.
- **Defense-in-Depth**: A security strategy that employs multiple layers of controls to protect assets, ensuring that if one layer fails, others continue to provide protection.
- **Detective Controls**: Security measures designed to identify security incidents during or after they occur, enabling response activities to limit damage.
- **Preventive Controls**: Security measures intended to stop security incidents before they occur by eliminating vulnerabilities or blocking threats.
- **Qualitative Risk Analysis**: A risk assessment approach that uses descriptive scales to evaluate the likelihood and impact of potential risks.
- **Quantitative Risk Analysis**: A risk assessment approach that assigns specific numeric values to risk components, enabling mathematical calculation of expected losses and other factors.
- **Return on Security Investment (ROSI)**: A metric for evaluating security investments, calculated as (Risk Reduction - Control Cost) / Control Cost.
- **Risk Acceptance Criteria**: Guidelines that establish thresholds for different risk levels and specify the appropriate response for each level.
- **Risk Rank Formula**: A method for prioritizing risks based on factors such as probability, impact, asset value, vulnerability score, and threat capability.

### Hands-on Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Incident Response Procedure Development
Develop a specific incident response procedure for a ransomware attack targeting a mid-sized organization. Your procedure should include:

1. Initial identification and triage approach
2. Containment measures appropriate for ransomware characteristics
3. Investigation methodology focusing on attack vector determination
4. Eradication and recovery approaches addressing the specific compromise
5. Communication templates for different stakeholder groups

Present your procedure as an actionable playbook that could guide actual response during similar incidents, including both technical actions and organizational coordination requirements.

#### Exercise 2: Evidence Collection and Handling
Design an evidence collection and handling methodology for a potential data breach scenario. Your methodology should address:

1. Initial evidence preservation prioritization given limited collection time
2. Specific collection techniques for different evidence types
3. Chain of custody documentation appropriate for potential regulatory reporting
4. Storage security measures ensuring evidence integrity
5. Analysis approach extracting actionable information from collected evidence

Present your methodology as a practical guide that technical responders could follow during actual incidents, including example documentation templates and specific tool recommendations.

#### Exercise 3: Post-Incident Analysis Framework
Develop a comprehensive post-incident analysis framework for evaluating response effectiveness following a significant security incident. Your framework should include:

1. Timeline reconstruction methodology capturing both technical events and organizational responses
2. Root cause analysis approach addressing technical, process, and organizational dimensions
3. Response effectiveness evaluation criteria for different response phases
4. Improvement identification and prioritization methodology
5. Implementation tracking process ensuring actual capability enhancement

Present your framework as a facilitator guide that could structure a post-incident review session, including specific questions, activities, and documentation approaches fostering honest assessment and actionable improvement identification.

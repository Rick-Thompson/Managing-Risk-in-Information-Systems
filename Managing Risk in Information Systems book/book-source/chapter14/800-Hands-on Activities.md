### Hands-On Exercises

1. **Quantum Readiness Assessment**

   Conduct a high-level assessment of an organization's quantum readiness. Identify systems and data that rely on potentially vulnerable cryptographic algorithms, prioritize these assets based on sensitivity and required protection lifetime, and develop a phased approach for implementing quantum-resistant alternatives.

2. **Zero Trust Design Exercise**

   Design a Zero Trust access model for a critical application. Define the protected resource, identify relevant users and their access needs, specify the verification factors that should be evaluated for access decisions, and outline the monitoring capabilities needed to detect potential compromise.

3. **Security Automation Planning**

   Select three security processes in an organization that would benefit from automation. For each process, document the current manual workflow, identify areas where automation could improve efficiency or effectiveness, outline the required integrations with existing tools, and develop metrics for measuring the impact of automation.

4. **AI Security Impact Analysis**

   Research and analyze how artificial intelligence might transform a specific security function (e.g., threat detection, vulnerability management, or user authentication). Identify potential benefits, challenges, required organizational capabilities, and implementation considerations.

5. **Emerging Threat Exercise**

   Research an emerging threat vector not extensively covered in the chapter (e.g., hardware vulnerabilities, cross-platform malware, or attacks targeting machine learning systems). Analyze the threat's potential impact, evaluate current defensive capabilities, and develop a strategic approach for enhancing protection against this threat.

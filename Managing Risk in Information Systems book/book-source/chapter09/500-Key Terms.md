### Key Terms

- **Active-Active Configuration**: A recovery approach where both primary and secondary systems simultaneously process workloads, providing both redundancy and additional operational capacity.
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA)**: The process of determining the potential consequences of disruption to critical business functions and using that information to establish recovery priorities and objectives.
- **Cyber-Physical Disaster**: A situation combining both digital security compromise and physical infrastructure disruption, creating complex recovery requirements across multiple dimensions.
- **Dependency Mapping**: The process of identifying relationships between different systems, applications, and infrastructure components to understand how failures might cascade through connected environments.
- **Geographic Distribution**: The practice of maintaining system components in physically separated locations to protect against regional disasters affecting multiple facilities simultaneously.
- **Post-Recovery Analysis**: Structured examination of disaster response effectiveness and underlying resilience capabilities conducted after restoration completion to drive continuous improvement.
- **Ransomware**: Malicious software that encrypts victim data then demands payment for decryption capabilities, effectively holding information systems hostage until payment or restoration from clean backups.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: The maximum acceptable time between system disruption and restoration, determining appropriate recovery strategy selection.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The process of identifying fundamental conditions creating or enabling failures rather than just addressing immediate technical symptoms.
- **Tabletop Exercise**: A discussion-based simulation where participants verbally work through disaster scenarios without actual system manipulation.

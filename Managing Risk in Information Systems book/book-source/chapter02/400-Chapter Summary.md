### Chapter Summary

This chapter established the foundational concepts and methodologies of information systems risk management. We began by exploring essential terminology, defining risk as the potential for loss resulting from the exploitation of vulnerabilities by threats, ultimately causing impacts to organizational assets. We examined the risk management lifecycle, which provides a structured approach through identification, assessment, mitigation, and monitoring phases, emphasizing that effective risk management is a continuous process rather than a one-time activity.

We then explored the critical process of asset identification, classification, and valuationâ€”the necessary first step in understanding what requires protection and its relative importance to organizational operations. The chapter introduced two powerful threat modeling methodologies: STRIDE, which systematically categorizes threats into six types (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privilege), and DREAD, which provides a framework for assessing threat severity based on Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability.

The chapter also covered various vulnerability assessment techniques, including automated scanning, manual testing, configuration reviews, and social engineering assessments, highlighting how each approach contributes to a comprehensive security evaluation. Finally, we walked through a practical exercise in building a threat model for an e-commerce system, demonstrating how to apply the theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. Together, these frameworks and methodologies provide the foundation for proactive security risk management, enabling IT professionals to anticipate and address potential problems before they materialize into security incidents.

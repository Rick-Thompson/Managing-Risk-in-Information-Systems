### Chapter Summary

This chapter introduced the fundamental concepts of information systems risk management. We examined how information systems have evolved from basic data processing tools to complex ecosystems that enable critical business functions. We explored the diverse threat landscape, including natural disasters, technical failures, human errors, and malicious attacks. We identified the key stakeholders involved in information systems management, from board members and executives to IT specialists and end users. We built the business case for risk management, connecting security investments to financial outcomes, regulatory compliance, customer expectations, and reputational protection. Finally, we examined a case study that illustrated how effective risk management can transform from a cost center to a strategic enabler that creates competitive advantage.

As we progress through this textbook, we will explore the specific methodologies, technologies, and practices that organizations use to manage information system risks. The following chapters will provide detailed guidance on risk assessment, control selection, business continuity planning, and other essential components of a comprehensive risk management program. Throughout, we will maintain this focus on the business value of risk management, recognizing that technical controls and security measures support organizational objectives through the protection and optimal use of information assets.

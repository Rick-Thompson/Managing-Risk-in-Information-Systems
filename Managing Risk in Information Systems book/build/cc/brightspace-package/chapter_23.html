<p>Incidents may be reported through the following channels: - IT Help
Desk: [Phone Number, Email] - Security Operations Center: [Phone Number,
Email] - Online Incident Reporting Form: [URL] - Direct notification to
Incident Response Team: [Contact Details]</p>

</ol>
<h5 id="phase-4-containment">Phase 4: Containment</h5>
<p><strong>Immediate Containment Strategies</strong> - Isolate affected
systems from the network - Block malicious IP addresses or domains -
Disable compromised user accounts - Implement temporary access
restrictions - Filter specific types of network traffic - Activate
enhanced monitoring</p>
<p><strong>Short-term Containment</strong> - Create forensic images of
affected systems - Implement temporary workarounds for affected
functions - Deploy emergency security patches - Rotate compromised
credentials - Enhance logging on similar systems</p>
<p><strong>Containment Decision Factors</strong> - Potential damage to
and criticality of affected resources - Need for evidence preservation -
Service availability requirements - Time and resources needed for
containment - Effectiveness of containment strategy - Potential for
additional damage without containment</p>
<h5 id="phase-5-investigation-and-evidence-collection">Phase 5:
Investigation and Evidence Collection</h5>
<p><strong>Investigation Process</strong> 1. Document the initial state
of affected systems 2. Identify and preserve sources of evidence 3.
Collect volatile data before powering down systems (if required) 4.
Create forensic images of affected systems 5. Secure original evidence
and maintain chain of custody 6. Analyze forensic images and collected
data 7. Reconstruct sequence of events 8. Identify affected systems,
accounts, and data 9. Determine attack vectors and exploited
vulnerabilities 10. Identify indicators of compromise for detection
enhancement</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Handling Guidelines</strong> - Use write-blockers
when creating forensic images - Maintain detailed evidence log including
timestamps and personnel - Store evidence in secure location with
restricted access - Document chain of custody for all evidence -
Generate cryptographic hashes of evidence files - Follow legal counsel
guidance on evidence preservation</p>
<h5 id="phase-6-eradication">Phase 6: Eradication</h5>
<p><strong>Eradication Activities</strong> - Remove malware and
unauthorized software - Disable backdoor accounts and unauthorized
access points - Patch exploited vulnerabilities - Reset compromised
credentials - Rebuild compromised systems from trusted sources -

<h5 id="purpose-and-scope-3">1. Purpose and Scope</h5>
<p>This standard establishes a framework for classifying and handling
information based on its sensitivity and criticality to the
organization. It defines data classification levels, associated handling
requirements, and responsibilities for data protection.</p>
<p>This standard applies to all information created, received, stored,
or transmitted by or on behalf of [Organization Name], regardless of
format or medium.</p>
<h5 id="data-classification-levels">2. Data Classification Levels</h5>
<p>Information assets are classified into the following categories based
on sensitivity and potential impact if compromised:</p>
<p><strong>Restricted</strong> - Definition: Highly sensitive
information that would cause severe harm to the organization, its
customers, or partners if disclosed, modified, or destroyed without
authorization. - Examples: Customer financial data, authentication
credentials, security infrastructure details, strategic business plans,
merger and acquisition information, personal health information. -
Impact of compromise: Significant financial loss, severe regulatory
penalties, serious reputational damage, business disruption, or
violation of individual privacy rights.</p>
<p><strong>Confidential</strong> - Definition: Sensitive information
intended for use within the organization with limited distribution based
on business need. - Examples: Employee personal information, internal
financial data, contractual agreements, detailed product specifications,
security assessment reports, non-public business metrics. - Impact of
compromise: Moderate financial loss, compliance violations, competitive
disadvantage, or privacy concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Internal</strong> - Definition: Information for general
internal use that is not intended for public disclosure but has limited
sensitivity. - Examples: Internal announcements, departmental
procedures, organizational charts, training materials, meeting minutes,
project schedules. - Impact of compromise: Minor financial loss,
operational inefficiency, or short-term embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>Public</strong> - Definition: Information explicitly approved
for public release with no restrictions on distribution. - Examples:
Marketing materials, press releases, public financial reports, job
postings, product brochures. - Impact of compromise: Minimal to no
adverse impact on operations, finances, or reputation.</p>

# 14-Week Course Outline: Managing Risk in Information Systems  

## Week 1: Introduction to Information Systems Management  
- Overview of information systems management  
- Role of risk management in IT  
- Key stakeholders and organizational goals  
- The evolving threat landscape  

---

## Week 2: Risk Management Fundamentals & Identification  
- Core terminology (risk, threat, vulnerability, impact)  
- Risk management lifecycle (identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring)  
- Asset identification, classification, and valuation  
- Threat modeling (STRIDE, DREAD) and vulnerability assessments  

---

## Week 3: Risk Quantification & Mitigation  
- Qualitative vs. quantitative risk analysis  
- Risk Rank formula: `(probability × impact) / mitigation cost`  
- Security controls (preventive, detective, corrective) and defense-in-depth  
- Cost-benefit analysis and residual risk management  

---

## Week 4: Backup Strategies & the 3-2-1 Rule  
- Importance of backups in risk mitigation  
- **Deep dive into the 3-2-1 rule**: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite  
- Backup technologies: Full, incremental, differential, and synthetic backups  
- Media selection (tape, cloud, disk) and encryption best practices  

---

## Week 5: Advanced Backup Systems & Validation  
- Backup scheduling and automation tools  
- Retention policies and legal/regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)  
- **Workshop**: Testing backup integrity (simulated recovery exercises)  
- Case study: Lessons from backup failures (e.g., ransomware attacks)  

---

## Week 6: Backup Restoration & Testing  
- **Backup restoration methodologies**: Full vs. partial restores  
- Testing backup usability (file-level and system-level recovery)  
- Validation techniques: Checksums, consistency checks, and version verification  
- **Workshop**: Simulated disaster scenario – Restoring systems from backups  
- Case study: *GitLab’s 2017 data loss incident* – Lessons in backup validation  

---

## Week 7: Business Impact Analysis (BIA) & Continuity Planning  
- **BIA**: Methodologies and critical function identification  
- Impact categories (financial, operational, reputational)  
- Determining RTO and RPO  
- **BCP**: Developing a continuity framework and alternate site strategies (hot, warm, cold sites)  
- Communication plans during disruptions  
- **Workshop**: Combined BIA/BCP tabletop exercise  

---

## Week 8: Disaster Recovery Planning – Foundations  
- DRP vs. BCP: Key differences  
- Technology recovery strategies (cloud, on-premises, hybrid)  
- Crisis communication and stakeholder management  
- **Case Study**: Hurricane Katrina – Lessons in infrastructure recovery  

---

## Week 9: Disaster Recovery Scenarios & Simulations  
- **Real-World DR Situations**:  
  - 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake/Tsunami: Data center recovery in Japan  
  - AWS Outage (2021): Cloud dependency risks and failover strategies  
  - Ransomware Attacks on Hospitals: Restoring critical systems under pressure  
- **Workshop**: Simulated DR exercise – Responding to a cyber-physical disaster  
- DRP testing metrics and post-recovery audits  

---

## Week 10: Incident Response Management  
- Incident response lifecycle (detection, containment, eradication, recovery)  
- Building an incident response team (IRT)  
- Post-incident analysis and reporting  
- **Real-world example**: Colonial Pipeline Ransomware response  

---

## Week 11: Case Studies in Information Risk Management (Chapter 16)  
- **Real-world successes and failures**: Equifax, SolarWinds, Target  
- Lessons learned from major security incidents  
- Industry-specific approaches (healthcare, finance, critical infrastructure)  
- **Workshop**: Root-cause analysis of a breach and mitigation design  

---

## Week 12: Risk Management Program Implementation (Chapter 17)  
- Building a risk-aware culture and governance framework  
- Resource allocation, budgeting, and tool selection  
- Metrics for effectiveness (KPIs, KRIs, ROI)  
- Continuous improvement and maturity models  

---

## Week 13: Advanced Case Studies  
- **In-depth analysis**: NotPetya, Colonial Pipeline, Log4j vulnerabilities  
- Cross-industry risk management comparisons  
- Role-playing exercise: Responding to a simulated breach  

---

## Week 14: Future Trends in Risk Management  
- Emerging threats (AI-driven attacks, quantum computing risks)  
- Evolving frameworks (Zero Trust, DevSecOps)  
- The role of automation and AI in risk mitigation  
- Student-led debate: Balancing innovation vs. security

This report presents a comprehensive curriculum and book outline for an IT 171 course on Managing Risk in Information Systems. The proposed content incorporates industry best practices, focuses heavily on backup strategies, and includes the specified risk quantification methodology to prepare students for real-world information systems risk management.

## Introduction to IT Risk Management

The foundation of effective information systems management begins with understanding risk as a business concept. Risk management in IT is not merely a technical consideration but a critical business function that supports organizational goals and protects valuable assets. This section establishes the fundamental concepts that form the basis of IT risk management.

### Risk Fundamentals and Governance

Information technology risk is fundamentally business risk, as demonstrated by numerous high-profile IT failures affecting various stakeholders including clients, employees, shareholders, and management[1]. A comprehensive approach to IT risk management must define risk in the context of organizational missions, establish appropriate governance structures, and address financial reporting standards. This section would explore how security supports business missions through properly structured governance models that include tiered organizations, boards, and senior management[1]. Additionally, it would examine privacy expectations, economic issues in IT risk management, and methods to ensure business goals align with IT initiatives[1].

### IT Risk Management Leadership

Effective IT risk management requires clear leadership roles. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) must anticipate the next generation of risks, while the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) play critical roles in implementing risk strategies and managing data security levels[1]. This section would cover risk strategy development, organizational structures, and self-audit methodologies that form the foundation of a proactive risk management program.

### Risk Management Frameworks and Standards

Organizations rely on established frameworks to implement consistent risk management practices. Three prominent frameworks include NIST SP 800-37, ISO 27005, and the FAIR standard[4]. The FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) model combines three aspects of risk—personnel, policies, processes, and technologies—to reduce risks to an acceptable level of loss exposure[4]. Students would learn how to build a cost-effective program that meets these frameworks' requirements, make well-informed risk management decisions, compare risk decisions to prioritize high-value vulnerabilities, communicate meaningful measurements to stakeholders, and develop accurate risk models based on actual scenarios[4].

## Risk Assessment Methodologies

Structured risk assessment provides the data necessary for informed decision-making. This section covers the complete risk assessment lifecycle, from identification through quantification.

### Risk Identification Techniques

Risk identification forms the cornerstone of effective risk management. This section would teach students how to conduct risk workshops, develop risk assessment matrices, identify triggers and symptoms of risk events, and understand the cause and effect relationships of various risks[2]. Students would learn to categorize threats and opportunities while identifying common IT risk sources that frequently impact organizations[2].

### Risk Qualification and Analysis

Once risks are identified, they must be analyzed and prioritized. Methods for risk qualification include assessing probability and impact, ranking risks, and establishing priority levels for remediation[2][4]. This section would explore risk qualification techniques such as risk ranking, prioritization methodologies, and probability-impact matrices that help organizations focus resources on the most significant threats.

### Risk Quantification Models

The course would emphasize quantitative approaches to risk assessment using the formula: Risk rank = (probability of event × potential impact) / minimum non-recoverable cost to mitigate. This approach provides a numerical foundation for risk-based decision making. For cyber risk specifically, students would learn that CyberRisk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact, combining the possibility of a cyber threat, system vulnerabilities, and the impact of a successful attack[4]. This mathematical approach to risk quantification helps organizations prioritize security measures and allocate resources efficiently.

## Backup Planning and Implementation

Given the emphasis on backup strategies for this course, this section provides comprehensive coverage of backup planning, implementation, and management.

### Backup Strategy Foundations

Data backup is a critical component of any cybersecurity program, ensuring that important information and systems are protected from potential threats. Without effective backup planning, organizations face serious risks of data loss and inability to restore systems following failures or disasters[3]. This section would cover the critical importance of backup planning, which aims to minimize data loss risk and reduce recovery time in failure scenarios[3].

### Developing a Comprehensive Backup Plan

Creating an effective backup plan involves a systematic approach. The course would cover the four essential steps: determining the scope of the dataset (identifying critical data and systems requiring protection), deciding backup frequency (based on data importance and potential impact of loss), selecting appropriate backup solutions (considering various backup technologies), and testing the backup strategy regularly to ensure reliability[3]. The section would explore different backup types including full, incremental, and differential backups, explaining their respective advantages and disadvantages[3][8].

### Backup Strategy Best Practices

Best practices in backup strategy implementation include regularly testing and verifying backups, storing backups in multiple locations (on-site and off-site), using encryption to protect sensitive data, automating and scheduling the backup process, regularly reviewing and updating the backup plan, maintaining a disaster recovery plan, training employees on backup procedures, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, or GDPR[3]. This section would provide practical guidance on implementing these best practices in various organizational contexts.

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

Business continuity planning and disaster recovery are essential extensions of the risk management process, providing systematic approaches to maintaining operations during disruptions.

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

Business Impact Analysis is fundamental to continuity planning. This section would teach students how to conduct a BIA, including identifying critical business functions, determining recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs), and creating BIA documentation[5]. Students would learn BIA mathematics and calculations that help quantify the potential impact of disruptions on business operations[5].

### Developing Business Continuity Plans

Business continuity planning involves creating detailed strategies to maintain critical business functions during disruptions. This section would cover the process of defining emergency protocols, developing communication strategies, forming specialized teams, and implementing cloud computing solutions to enhance resilience[5]. Students would also learn about key risk indicators (KRIs) and key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring business continuity and disaster recovery efforts[5].

### Disaster Recovery Planning and Implementation

Disaster recovery focuses specifically on restoring IT systems and data after a disruption. This section would address disaster recovery planning methodologies, testing procedures, and implementation strategies for organizations of various sizes, compositions, and industries[6]. Students would learn to construct effective disaster recovery plans that align with business priorities and risk tolerance levels.

## Operational Risk Management

Operational risk management addresses day-to-day risks that can impact information systems functionality and security.

### Control Self-Assessments and Key Risk Indicators

Operational risk management requires systematic identification and prioritization processes. Control self-assessments enable organizations to evaluate their existing controls, while key risk indicators provide early warning of potential issues[1]. This section would cover action planning based on assessment results, prioritization methodologies that consider likelihood versus impact, operational risk reporting systems, and operational improvement approaches such as Six Sigma and Total Quality Management[1].

### Risk Response Planning

Effective risk management requires predetermined response strategies. This section would address contingency planning, risk avoidance through deference strategies, determining the cost of risk and needed contingency reserves, and developing comprehensive risk response plans[2]. Students would learn to identify appropriate response strategies for different risk scenarios and implement those strategies effectively.

### Risk Management and Control

Maintaining control over identified risks requires ongoing monitoring and management. This section would explore change control practices, risk response plan updates, corrective actions, and workarounds that help organizations manage risks throughout their lifecycle[2]. Students would also learn strategies for communicating negative information to stakeholders, an essential skill for risk managers[2].

## Third-Party Risk Management

As organizations increasingly rely on vendors and partners, third-party risk management becomes critical to overall security posture.

### Third-Party Risk Assessment

Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) addresses risks associated with external vendors and partners. This section would cover assessment methodologies, due diligence processes, and risk-based approaches to vendor selection and management[7]. Students would learn to evaluate third-party security practices and integrate them into the organization's overall risk management program.

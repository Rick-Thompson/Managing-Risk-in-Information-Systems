# Case Study 1: Gaille Media – Hurricane Harvey (2017) Success

**Company:** Gaille Media is a small internet marketing agency based near Houston, Texas, with a team of only a few employees and freelancers.  

**Incident (Natural Disaster):** In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey struck Houston with unprecedented rainfall. Gaille Media’s second-floor office flooded when a nearby lake overflowed, and the building became inaccessible for three months due to high water and mold ([6 Small Businesses Share Disaster Recovery Stories](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/08/31/499908.htm#:~:text=Gaille%E2%80%99s%20second,had%20to%20wear%20a%20mask)). Such severe flooding could have wiped out the company’s computers and on-site files, halting operations indefinitely.

**Backup Strategy:** Fortunately, Gaille Media had embraced cloud storage and remote work tools before the disaster. **Most of the company’s critical documents and records were stored online**, not just on office computers ([6 Small Businesses Share Disaster Recovery Stories](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/08/31/499908.htm#:~:text=THE%20RECOVERY%3A%20Gaille%20and%20his,the%20remote%20work%20arrangement%20permanent)). This meant that even though physical equipment was damaged by the storm, the data itself remained safe and accessible from anywhere. The staff could work from home or any location with internet access. Regularly using cloud-based services essentially served as an offsite backup of all important business data.

**Recovery Outcome:** **Gaille Media was able to continue operations with minimal disruption**, despite the office loss ([6 Small Businesses Share Disaster Recovery Stories](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/08/31/499908.htm#:~:text=THE%20RECOVERY%3A%20Gaille%20and%20his,the%20remote%20work%20arrangement%20permanent)). The owner and two staff members switched to working remotely immediately. They did not lose client files or important records to the flood, thanks to their cloud backups. By the time they could re-enter the building months later, the business had already adjusted to a fully remote model. In fact, one employee requested to **make the remote arrangement permanent** after seeing how well it worked ([6 Small Businesses Share Disaster Recovery Stories](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/08/31/499908.htm#:~:text=working%20because%20most%20of%20their,the%20remote%20work%20arrangement%20permanent)). Gaille Media saved thousands of dollars on overhead by giving up its physical office, and even post-disaster, the company continued serving clients without significant downtime. **Because its data was backed up remotely, this small business quickly recovered from Harvey’s devastation.**

**Lessons Learned:**  
- **Cloud Backups Enable Resilience:** Storing files in the cloud protected Gaille Media’s data from local disaster damage ([6 Small Businesses Share Disaster Recovery Stories](https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/08/31/499908.htm#:~:text=THE%20RECOVERY%3A%20Gaille%20and%20his,the%20remote%20work%20arrangement%20permanent)). Offsite backups (whether cloud-based or remote physical copies) are critical in flood-prone areas.  
- **Business Continuity Planning:** Because they could work remotely with cloud-based systems, employees stayed productive. A well-thought-out continuity plan (in this case, leveraging remote access to backed-up data) can keep a business running even if the physical office is destroyed.  
- **Regular Backup of All Critical Data:** The case highlights that even a very small company should identify its critical data (client projects, operational documents, etc.) and ensure those are continually backed up to a safe location. This preparation can make the difference between **a quick recovery and permanent closure** – especially when 40% of small businesses never reopen after a major disaster (['It will always work out': Patzer Woodworking celebrates 40 years of business, overcoming floods, fires - Mitchell Republic | News, weather, sports from Mitchell South Dakota](https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/local/it-will-always-work-out-patzer-woodworking-celebrates-40-years-of-business-overcoming-floods-fires#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Federal%20Emergency,a%20year%2C%20FEMA%E2%80%99s%20data%20says)).

# Case Study 2: Small Businesses & Hurricane Sandy (2012) Failure

**Company:** *Multiple local small businesses in New York City* – exemplifying a common scenario rather than one single firm. For instance, consider a family-owned retail business in Lower Manhattan with a few employees. It had a basic nightly backup system that saved data to an external hard drive in the office. The owners believed their data was safe as long as they backed it up regularly, and they did not utilize any off-site or cloud storage for their point-of-sale and customer records.

**Incident (Natural Disaster):** In October 2012, **Hurricane Sandy** struck the Northeast. New York City experienced severe flooding, especially downtown. Our example small retailer’s shop was in a flood zone; **storm surge waters inundated the store and its back-office**. The company’s main server and the external backup drive were both destroyed by water. Unfortunately, this scenario was common – **many businesses with on-site IT infrastructure lost all their files and applications as floods destroyed their equipment during Sandy** ([IronOrbit After Sandy: The Data That Survived The Storm - IronOrbit](https://www.ironorbit.com/cloud_disaster_recovery/#:~:text=Many%20businesses%20in%20the%20northeastern,websites%20Gawker%2C%20Buzzfeed%2C%20and%20the)). Even businesses that protected hardware from water often suffered extended power outages, rendering on-site systems unusable ([IronOrbit After Sandy: The Data That Survived The Storm - IronOrbit](https://www.ironorbit.com/cloud_disaster_recovery/#:~:text=destroyed%20their%20computing%20equipment%E2%80%94part%20of,150%2C000%20in)).

**Backup Strategy:** The business **did have a backup system, but it was entirely on-site**, which proved ineffective. The backups were stored in the same location as the primary systems, violating the best practice of geographic redundancy. There was no cloud backup or offsite copy of critical data. Thus, when the flood hit, the primary data **and** the backups were both wiped out simultaneously. The owners attempted to recover the water-damaged drives, but professional data recovery yielded little success (and at high cost). 

**Recovery Outcome:** **This lack of an offsite backup proved fatal to the business.** With all financial records, customer databases, and inventory lists destroyed, the company had no practical way to resume operations quickly. They faced weeks of trying to reconstruct data from paper records and memory. During that downtime, they hemorrhaged revenue. This small business ultimately **never recovered from the disaster**. Unfortunately, their story was far from unique – after Sandy, *“many establishments never reopened”* in hard-hit areas ([Hurricane Sandy, 10 Years - Coney Island Museum](https://www.coneyislandmuseum.org/hurricane-sandy#:~:text=Hurricane%20Sandy%2C%2010%20Years%20,Island%20USA%27s%20General%20Manager)). More broadly, FEMA estimates that **almost 40% of small businesses never reopen after a catastrophic natural disaster**, and an additional 25% fail within one year (['It will always work out': Patzer Woodworking celebrates 40 years of business, overcoming floods, fires - Mitchell Republic | News, weather, sports from Mitchell South Dakota](https://www.mitchellrepublic.com/news/local/it-will-always-work-out-patzer-woodworking-celebrates-40-years-of-business-overcoming-floods-fires#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Federal%20Emergency,a%20year%2C%20FEMA%E2%80%99s%20data%20says)). In this case, the combination of physical destruction and total data loss forced the owners to shut down. The lesson came too late: off-site or cloud backups might have saved the business’s data and given it a fighting chance to rebuild.

**Lessons Learned:**  
- **Offsite Backups Are Crucial:** Simply having backups isn’t enough if they are stored in the same location as the primary data. In a flood or fire, **on-site backups can be destroyed along with the original data** ([IronOrbit After Sandy: The Data That Survived The Storm - IronOrbit](https://www.ironorbit.com/cloud_disaster_recovery/#:~:text=Many%20businesses%20in%20the%20northeastern,websites%20Gawker%2C%20Buzzfeed%2C%20and%20the)). Businesses should maintain redundant backups in a separate geographic location or in the cloud to ensure data survival.  
- **Disaster Preparedness:** Small businesses must include worst-case natural disaster scenarios in their IT planning. The case highlights that *“once-in-a-lifetime” storms do happen and can recur* ([IronOrbit After Sandy: The Data That Survived The Storm - IronOrbit](https://www.ironorbit.com/cloud_disaster_recovery/#:~:text=Businesses%20caught%20off,have%20all%20happened)). Regular risk assessments and disaster recovery plans (including where data is backed up) might have prevented this total loss.  
- **Test and Update Backup Systems:** If this business had tested its disaster recovery, it would have realized that recovering from an on-site backup after a flood was impossible. Regularly testing backups and recovery procedures ensures you can actually restore data in an emergency. It’s not enough to assume data is backed up – you need confidence it can be retrieved on new hardware at a new location.  
- **Consequences of Failure:** The sobering outcome underscores that a lack of proper backups can lead to permanent business closure. Data is the lifeblood of many operations, and losing it can mean losing customers, billing ability, and institutional knowledge overnight. The cost of robust off-site backup is minor compared to the cost of losing your entire business.

# Case Study 3: G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers – Ransomware Attack (2021) Success

**Company:** G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers, Inc. – a large family-owned beverage bottling company serving Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. With around 2,000 employees and a dozen facilities, G&J Pepsi is a mid-sized enterprise (about $650 million annual revenue). Despite its size, it’s still privately owned and operated like a regional business. The company has an eight-person IT team responsible for system upkeep and security ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=At%20the%20CyberRisk%20Leadership%20Exchange,a%20dime%20to%20the%20attackers)).

**Incident (Cyberattack – Ransomware):** In early September 2021 (over a holiday weekend), G&J Pepsi fell victim to a **ransomware attack**. Attackers had infiltrated the network (likely via a tool like Cobalt Strike) and planted backdoors in the system ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=The%20company%20first%20noticed%20something,Labor%20Day%20weekend%20of%202021)). Early one morning, an alert came in from a plant: users could not access files – a telltale sign of ransomware encrypting data ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=nothing,around%204%3A30%20in%20the%20morning)). Immediately, IT staff discovered active ransomware spreading across servers. They faced a crisis: file access was blocked company-wide, and the attackers were demanding payment to decrypt critical business data.

**Backup Strategy:** Luckily, G&J Pepsi had robust backup and disaster recovery measures in place. The company had **weekly backups of its systems stored offline and in the cloud** (hosted on Azure cloud infrastructure) ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=spend%20the%20next%20few%20hours,to%20investigate%20the%20infected%20systems)). As soon as the attack was detected, the IT team took systems offline to contain the malware’s spread ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=weird%2C%20I%20can%27t%20access%20files%2C%27,that%20we%20were%20under%20attack)). They then initiated their disaster recovery plan. Instead of attempting to decrypt infected servers, they chose to **restore clean data from backups onto new instances**. Because their backups were isolated, **the ransomware did not corrupt the backup files** ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=match%20at%20L142%20G%26J%20Pepsi,company%20data%20having%20been%20stolen)). Within hours, the team spun up fresh servers in Azure and began loading the most recent backup images.

**Recovery Outcome:** **G&J Pepsi achieved a remarkably fast recovery – in about 7 hours, they restored operations without paying any ransom** ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=officer%20of%20an%20Ohio%20bottling,a%20dime%20to%20the%20attackers)). The company’s executive vice president reported that *“We never missed an order. We never missed a delivery. Customer data was not compromised,”* despite the attack ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=without%20losing%20any%20business%20and,a%20dime%20to%20the%20attackers)). In other words, the business continued almost seamlessly. Most employees outside of IT had no idea a major incident was happening. By using their clean backups to rebuild systems, G&J avoided both the ransom payment and prolonged downtime. **None of the backed-up data was lost**, and systems were back to normal by the same afternoon. This outcome was so successful that it was highlighted at a cybersecurity conference as an example of effective incident response. The company did harden its policies afterward (e.g. requiring password resets, limiting admin accounts, etc. ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=,Balzer%20says))), but the key takeaway is that its backup-centric recovery plan prevented catastrophe. This case shows that even a mid-sized business can bounce back from ransomware **if it has reliable, segregated backups and a tested recovery plan**.

**Lessons Learned:**  
- **Isolate and Secure Backups:** G&J Pepsi’s backups were kept such that the ransomware couldn’t reach them ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=match%20at%20L142%20G%26J%20Pepsi,company%20data%20having%20been%20stolen)). This “air-gap” or secure backup storage is vital – if your backups are online and accessible during an attack, they can be encrypted too. Regular offline or cloud backups protected by strong access controls ensured the company had a clean restore point.  
- **Rapid Recovery Process:** Having an **incident response plan** that included rapid restoration from backups was crucial. G&J’s IT team had prepared for this scenario and could quickly “flip the switch” to their backup systems ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=weird%2C%20I%20can%27t%20access%20files%2C%27,that%20we%20were%20under%20attack)) ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=spend%20the%20next%20few%20hours,to%20investigate%20the%20infected%20systems)). Regular drills or run-throughs of restoring from backups can drastically reduce downtime after an attack.  
- **Business Continuity Wins:** Because of quick action, G&J Pepsi suffered **no significant operational downtime or data loss**. This underscores that investing in backup and disaster-recovery solutions (like cloud infrastructure and image backups) pays off. For a distribution business, missing orders or deliveries can be very costly; their investment in continuity prevented millions in losses.  
- **Leadership and Culture Matter:** The case also highlighted the support from top management – the CEO authorized shutting down systems immediately, which contained the damage ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=weird%2C%20I%20can%27t%20access%20files%2C%27,that%20we%20were%20under%20attack)). A culture that prioritizes cybersecurity and empowers IT to act decisively is a non-technical but important factor in successful recovery.  
- **Post-Incident Improvements:** Even with a solid outcome, G&J Pepsi learned and improved their security post-attack (tightening account controls, MFA, etc.) ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware#:~:text=,Balzer%20says)). A lesson is that **every incident should lead to refining your backup and security policies**. Regularly update your backup strategies (frequency, retention, testing) as threats evolve.

# Case Study 4: Brookside ENT Clinic – Ransomware Attack (2019) Failure

**Company:** Brookside ENT & Hearing Center – a **two-physician medical practice** in Battle Creek, Michigan. It was a small healthcare business providing ear, nose, and throat services. With only two doctors and a small staff, Brookside ENT relied on its medical records database for patient history, scheduling, and billing. The practice did have a computer backup system, which saved data to a local server and an external drive. However, like many small offices, they had no dedicated IT department – one of the doctors or a hired consultant handled basic IT and backups.

**Incident (Cyberattack – Ransomware):** In early 2019, Brookside ENT became the victim of a **ransomware attack** that represents a worst-case scenario for any business. Hackers breached the clinic’s network (reportedly via an email virus) and **executed a ransomware program that systematically deleted or encrypted every digital file the practice had**, including patient electronic medical records, billing information, and appointment schedules ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=At%20Brookside%20ENT%20in%20Battle,doctors%20at%20the%20clinic%20said)). The attackers didn’t stop at the primary files – **the ransomware also wiped out all the clinic’s backups** that were accessible on the network ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=At%20Brookside%20ENT%20in%20Battle,doctors%20at%20the%20clinic%20said)). Essentially, the clinic’s entire patient database and all backups were destroyed in one stroke. The malicious program left behind a single encrypted copy of the data and a note: the files could be unlocked with a password — if the doctors paid a ransom of about $6,500 ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=deleting%20and%20overwriting%20every%20medical,doctors%20at%20the%20clinic%20said)).

**Backup Strategy:** Brookside ENT **did have backups, but they were not resilient** against this type of attack. The practice likely performed regular in-office backups to a server or external drive, but those were connected to the network. The ransomware was able to encrypt/delete those backup copies as well ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=At%20Brookside%20ENT%20in%20Battle,doctors%20at%20the%20clinic%20said)). They had **no off-site or offline backups** to fall back on. In addition, it appears they had never tested a scenario of restoring all systems from scratch. When faced with total data loss, their backup plan provided no recovery path – the latest records existed only in the hands of the attackers.

**Recovery Outcome:** **Brookside ENT faced an impossible situation:** pay the criminals or lose all patient data. The two physicians consulted with law enforcement (the FBI was involved) and decided **not to pay the ransom** – a principled stand, but one that meant they could not retrieve their patients’ records ([Medical Practice to Close in Wake of Ransomware Attack](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/medical-practice-to-close-in-wake-ransomware-attack-a-12321#:~:text=The%20two,down%20the%20practice%20for%20good)). With decades of medical charts and information gone, the doctors had to cancel all appointments. They realized they could not rebuild the practice’s files from memory or paper; nearly everything was digitized. Within weeks, the owners announced that Brookside ENT would **permanently close its doors** ([Medical Practice to Close in Wake of Ransomware Attack](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/medical-practice-to-close-in-wake-ransomware-attack-a-12321#:~:text=The%20two,down%20the%20practice%20for%20good)). Rather than attempt an extremely costly system rebuild (with no guarantees of success), the two physicians chose to retire early and shut down the clinic ([Medical Practice to Close in Wake of Ransomware Attack](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/medical-practice-to-close-in-wake-ransomware-attack-a-12321#:~:text=The%20two,down%20the%20practice%20for%20good)). This small practice became one of the first healthcare providers in the nation to close due solely to a ransomware attack ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=A%20computer%20virus%20recently%20injected,Services%20and%20ruined%20the%20business)) ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=The%20two,of%20work%20have%20been%20temporary)). The outcome was devastating: thousands of patient records were lost forever, and the community lost a medical provider. Brookside ENT’s experience is cited by cybersecurity experts as a cautionary tale of how a **backup strategy that fails can lead to business failure** ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=A%20computer%20virus%20recently%20injected,Services%20and%20ruined%20the%20business)).

 ([How a midsize American business recovered from a ransomware attack in less than a day | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/resource/24-hour-recovery-how-an-american-business-beat-ransomware)) *A conceptual image representing a ransomware attack. In the Brookside ENT case, attackers encrypted all of the clinic’s files – including connected backups – and demanded payment for the decryption key ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=At%20Brookside%20ENT%20in%20Battle,doctors%20at%20the%20clinic%20said)). The clinic’s inability to restore its data forced it to close permanently.* ([Medical Practice to Close in Wake of Ransomware Attack](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/medical-practice-to-close-in-wake-ransomware-attack-a-12321#:~:text=The%20two,down%20the%20practice%20for%20good))

**Lessons Learned:**  
- **Networks Need Offsite or Immutable Backups:** Brookside ENT did back up its data, but the backups were on-network and thus **vulnerable to the ransomware** ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=At%20Brookside%20ENT%20in%20Battle,doctors%20at%20the%20clinic%20said)). The clinic’s story highlights the importance of having backups that are offline, read-only (immutable), or stored in the cloud with proper security. If a backup can be reached by an attacker, it’s not a reliable backup. Regularly save critical data to an off-site location that ransomware cannot access (e.g., a cloud service with versioning, or offline tape backups).  
- **Verify Backup Restoration:** It’s not enough to create backups; you must **test restoring from them periodically**. Had Brookside ENT tested a full restore, they might have discovered weaknesses (like backups stored only on the main network). Testing also ensures you know how to get your systems running from backups quickly in an emergency.  
- **Small Businesses are Targeted Too:** This case dispels the notion that only large companies face serious cyber threats. Hackers specifically targeted a small medical office, and the impact was total. All businesses, even small clinics, need to invest in basic cybersecurity and backup defenses. As one analysis noted, ransomware is *“getting uglier…especially [for] small and mid-sized providers”* who may lack resources ([Medical Practice to Close in Wake of Ransomware Attack](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/medical-practice-to-close-in-wake-ransomware-attack-a-12321#:~:text=The%20decision%20to%20shutter%20Brookside,and%20hackers%20become%20more%20sophisticated)).  
- **No Backup, No Business:** Ultimately, the **lack of a viable backup directly caused Brookside ENT to shut down**. Important records in digital form were not recoverable by any other means. This underscores that for many businesses, losing data means losing the ability to operate. About one-third of companies that experience a significant data loss eventually go out of business ([All of records erased, doctor's office closes after ransomware attack](https://www.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992#:~:text=Brian%20Stevenson%2C%20president%20of%20Roseville,he%20said)). Ensuring you can restore your data may literally save your company’s life.  
- **Professional Assistance and Insurance:** One takeaway is that small firms should consider cyber insurance and professional IT support. The clinic may have lacked dedicated IT guidance that could have set up better backups or detected the intrusion earlier. Investing in expert help and insurance coverage can mitigate the damage of such attacks. In Brookside’s case, the cost of proper backup solutions would have been trivial compared to the total loss of closing the business.

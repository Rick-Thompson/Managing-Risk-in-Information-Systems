//Total Points: 5
//5 Questions analyzing the ransomware incident and risk management challenges

//Question 1 - Multiple Choice
NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,ISRM101-CS001,,,
Title,Root Cause Analysis,,,
QuestionText,"Based on the case study, which combination of factors MOST directly enabled the ransomware attack to cause catastrophic damage to Mountain State Medical Supply?",,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,0,Limited internet infrastructure and geographic isolation in West Virginia,,These are challenges but not direct enablers of the attack's success
Option,0,Aging computer hardware and use of Windows Server 2019,,Old hardware is a concern but Server 2019 is relatively recent
Option,100,Encrypted backup files and lack of network segmentation,,Correct! These allowed the ransomware to spread and prevented recovery
Option,0,Small IT budget and reliance on family member for IT support,,These are constraints but not the direct technical enablers
Hint,Consider what technical failures allowed the ransomware to spread and prevented recovery,,,
Feedback,The encrypted backup files eliminated the primary recovery method, while lack of network segmentation allowed the ransomware to spread from one computer to the entire network, creating catastrophic damage.,,,

//Question 2 - Multi-Select
NewQuestion,MS,,,
ID,ISRM101-CS002,,,
Title,Cascading Business Impacts,,,
QuestionText,"Select ALL the cascading impacts that resulted from the ransomware attack on Mountain State Medical Supply's information systems:",,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Scoring,RightAnswers,,,
Option,1,Insurance claims worth $285,000 were delayed due to billing system outage,,This is explicitly mentioned as an impact
Option,1,VOIP phone systems became non-functional at all locations,,The case states phone systems were VOIP-based and went down
Option,0,The company's satellite internet connection failed,,Internet connectivity wasn't mentioned as failing
Option,1,150+ patients experienced delays receiving critical medical supplies,,This is stated as a customer impact
Option,1,Delivery routes were disrupted due to lack of customer information access,,This operational impact is specifically mentioned
Hint,Focus on what systems failed as a direct result of the ransomware encryption,,,
Feedback,"The ransomware's encryption of systems caused billing delays, phone outages (VOIP), delivery disruptions, and patient supply delays. Internet connectivity remained but was ineffective without functioning systems.",,,

//Question 3 - Multiple Choice
NewQuestion,MC,,,
ID,ISRM101-CS003,,,
Title,Risk Prioritization Strategy,,,
QuestionText,"Given Mountain State Medical Supply's limited budget and regional constraints, which risk management approach would provide the BEST return on investment?",,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,4,,,
Option,0,Invest primarily in cutting-edge security technologies like AI-based threat detection,,Too expensive and complex for their situation
Option,0,Focus exclusively on achieving full HIPAA compliance through documentation,,Compliance alone won't prevent incidents
Option,100,Implement employee security training combined with automated patching and cloud backups,,Correct! Cost-effective with high impact
Option,0,Relocate IT infrastructure to urban areas with better internet connectivity,,Not practical and doesn't address core vulnerabilities
Hint,Consider solutions that address human factors and technical vulnerabilities within budget constraints,,,
Feedback,"Employee training addresses the human factor (like clicking phishing emails), while automated patching and cloud backups provide technical protectionâ€”all achievable on a limited budget with high impact.",,,

//Question 4 - Matching
NewQuestion,M,,,
ID,ISRM101-CS004,,,
Title,Vulnerability Categories,,,
QuestionText,Match each specific vulnerability from the case study to its appropriate risk category:,,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
Scoring,EquallyWeighted,,,
Choice,1,Technical Vulnerability,,
Choice,2,Human Factor,,
Choice,3,Environmental Factor,,
Choice,4,Third-Party Risk,,
Match,1,Weekly backups stored on-site with no air-gapped copies,,
Match,2,Employee clicked on fake Medicare email attachment,,
Match,3,Satellite internet required at Princeton due to infrastructure limits,,
Match,4,Shared credentials with external billing service,,
Hint,Consider the primary nature of each vulnerability,,,
Feedback,"On-site only backups are a technical vulnerability, clicking phishing emails is human error, limited internet infrastructure is environmental, and shared vendor credentials create third-party risk.",,,

//Question 5 - True/False
NewQuestion,TF,,,
ID,ISRM101-CS005,,,
Title,Recovery Strategy Effectiveness,,,
QuestionText,"Mountain State Medical Supply's ability to implement manual processes for urgent orders during the ransomware attack demonstrates that technological solutions alone are insufficient for business continuity in small rural businesses.",,,
Points,1,,,
Difficulty,3,,,
TRUE,100,Correct! Manual processes saved critical operations when technology failed,,
FALSE,0,The case clearly shows manual processes were crucial during the outage,,
Feedback,"The case explicitly states that 'the ability to operate manually saved the business,' highlighting that business continuity requires both technological and non-technological (manual process) preparations, especially for small businesses with limited resources.",,,
